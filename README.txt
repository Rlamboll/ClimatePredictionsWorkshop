# Results from workshops on making predictions for geoscience and climate policy

The data folder contains the underlying results from the two workshops. 
The EGU24 workshop was held on 15 Apr 2024 in Vienna, attendees were mostly geoscientists with expertises in climate or oceanology.
The RGS workshop was held on the 29th August in London, attendees were mostly geographers studying sustainability, politics and finance. 

The questions in full are: 
1. What will global CO2 emissions be in 2024? (in billion tonnes CO2/year)
2. What will global CO2 emissions be in 2050? (in billion tonnes CO2/year)
3. Assuming we achieve and maintain net zero CO2, what will the change in total global mean surface temperature be between the year of net zero and 50 years later? (In degrees C)
4. What do you think the global mean surface temperature difference will be between the 1850-1900 average and the 2090-2110 average? (Degrees C)
5. What will global CO2 emissions be in 2100? (in billion tonnes CO2/year)

Each question has subquestions asking for highest, lowest, best guesses and probabiliy between highest and lowest for each estimate. We ask the questions once for each participant on their own, and once after group discussion. These are referred to as e.g. ZEC 1 for question 3 in the first instance and ZEC 2 for question 3 after discussion. 

The third question's second instance was accidentally asked twice in the EGU workshop instead of the 4th question, and a few people answered it as written before we notified people of the mistake. We have added metaquestion column to indicate instances where the form was likely filled in before this was brought to the attention of the participants. 

A calibration question on the fraction of countries with declining CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2023 requires databases to be downloaded from https://globalcarbonbudget.org/gcb-2024/ and copied into the data folder.
